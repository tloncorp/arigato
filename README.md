# Arigato

Arigato is a chatbot interface to ChatGPT and DALL-E

## Installing

```
|install ~botter-midsum-salrux %gato
|install ~botter-midsum-salrux %arigato
:gato &add ['prompt' [%arigato %prompt] !>(["your api key" ~[~sampel-palnet]])]
:gato &add ['image' [%arigato %image] !>(["your api key" ~[~sampel-palnet]])]
```

where ~sampel-palnet is the host of the chat you want the bot to post in. If the group and the chat are hosted on two different ships, use the latter

`/image a vintage computer in a garden in spring`
